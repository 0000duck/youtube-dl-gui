# youtube-dl-gui
GUI for [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl) + [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (which is used for converting).

It is what youtube visual downloaders should be, not bloated with adware or viruses like other places and it downloads from Google's servers so it's (technically) safer than a 3rd party site that could leak your information.

# Prerequisites
Requires .NET 4.5.

# Usage

When you first run this program, it'll ask for a directory to store downloaded files. Select your desired location and then set it. Afterwards, you can configure settings if you'd like or just straight up start downloading.

Downloading with custom formats and converting in any way will require [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), which you can download and put the files in "ffmpeg/bin/*.exe" in with the same directory as youtube-dl-gui or extract it anywhere and put the bin directory into your windows PATH.
